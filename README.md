## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (including external stylesheets for layout and responsive queries)
- JavaScript (for interactivity and AOS animations)
- [AOS (Animate On Scroll)](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) for smooth scroll animations
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons

## Setup & Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure the following folder structure is maintained, especially the `/Assets` folder with images and videos:
    ```
    /Assets/
      beach2.mp4
      hike.mp4
      roadtrip.mp4
      snow ride.mp4
      waterfall.mp4
      bali,indonesia.avif
      santorini.avif
      kyoto.avif
      machu.avif
      europe.avif
      asia.avif
      carribean.avif
      sarahj.avif
      michChen.avif
      EmilyR.avif
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the landing page.
4. Customize the content, images, and styles as needed.

## Notes

- Video files and images must be placed correctly in the `/Assets` directory to load properly.
- The page uses AOS library for animation effects; ensure internet connectivity or host AOS files locally.
- Font Awesome icons require internet access via CDN or can be hosted locally.

## Future Improvements

- Implement backend integration for the adventure search form.
- Enhance accessibility and SEO features.
- Optimize video file sizes for better performance.
